# BombStepper-iOS
Hobby project.  This is an attempt to create a fast, modern Tetris clone on iOS.

I previously wrote a Tetris clone using Processing, which I called [BombStepper](http://quickies.mathemusician.net/tetris/BombStepper/applet/).  Having done a lot more coding since then, I decided to do a remake on iOS.

The goal of this clone is to allow a pro player play as fast as he/she could on a touch screen phone.  At a minimum, a 40L sprint under 60 seconds should be possible.  What might allow that, I figured, would be a customizable on-screen button layout with customizable gestures.

This is also a chance for me to explore SpriteKit, try new Swift syntax, and practice structuring code.

The game's foundational parts are done i.e. the core game mechanics with SRS rotation system.  There's a working button layout editor, but normal game modes don't yet load the custom layout.  It also needs more interesting game modes other than 40L.  Nevertheless this project is put on hold and I'll come back to it when I feel like.
